Download
========

To download *Lift* to your local machine perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that ``git`` and ``git-lfs`` are installed on your machine

   *Lift* is distributed via https://github.com using the ``git`` version control system [#github]_.

   To download *Lift* to your computer you, therefore, have to first ensure that you have ``git`` and ``git-lfs`` installed on your system::

        > git --version
        > git lfs version

   If this prints out an error message instead of an version number, you should install ``git`` and ``git-lfs`` via you Linux distribution's package manager or from the official webpages [#git]_ [#git-lfs]_.

2. Clone the *Lift* git repository

   Run the following command to clone the repository::

        > git clone https://github.com/lift-project/lift.git

   This will download the repository in a directory called ``lift`` in the current working directory.
